CHViewControllerSwitcher
=====================
CHViewControllerSwitcher is a replacement for UITabBarController, with useful features.

Why I created this
--------------------------
UITabBarController is a great selection interface. 
However, some people want: 
- a tab bar at the top of the window
- six or seven buttons on the tab bar
- their own tab bar

Features
-------------
- Allows you to create your own selection interface with UI-components.
- Allows you to use just some part of the window, not the full-screen mode.
- Allows you to custom frame sizes of the content view for the portrait/landscape modes.
